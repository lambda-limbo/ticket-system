# Ticket system

This is a simple ticket system built with JavaSE as an university assignment. We are aware, Java is not the best :poop: to
deal with, but we are dealing with it anyway.

The project uses Hibernate as the ORM solution as requested by the teacher (to be some sort of ORM) and also uses MVC as its
design software pattern as we've also been instructed to do by... guess who... the teacher.

That's all, for now.
